# .NET Fundamentals

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.

# History

.NET is a general-purpose development platform. It can be used for any kind of app type or workload where general purpose solutions are used. It has several key features that are attractive to many developers, as it combines high performance and richness with unique, differentiated developer productivity.

​.NET Framework is a very powerful and mature framework, with a huge class library that supports a wide variety of applications and solutions, only supported on Window. The last version that will be shipped by Microsoft will be .NET 4.8.

.NET Core is a new version of .NET which is a cross-platform, open-source and modular. It can be used for creating modern web apps, microservices, libraries and console applications that run everywhere (Windows, Linux and macOS). The last version of .Net Core that will be shipped will be .Net Core 3.1.

Unlike the traditional .NET Framework, which is a single package installation, system-wide, and Windows-only runtime environment, .NET Core is about decoupling .NET from Windows, allowing it to run in non-Windows environments without having to install a giant 400mb set of binaries (versus just the footprint of the components you need from .NET Core) plus the ability to deploy the applications coming with the framework itself supporting side-by-side execution of different versions of the framework.
With the Xamarin Platform, you can deliver native Android, iOS, macOS and Windows apps, using existing .NET skills, teams, and code.

The Xamarin Platform is based on Mono. Mono is the original open-source and cross-platform implementation of .NET, from the community Mono Project. It is now sponsored by Xamarin/Microsoft. Traditionally, Mono’s APIs have followed the progress of the .NET Framework, not .NET Core.

Open source is also an important part of the .NET ecosystem, with multiple .NET implementations and many libraries available under OSI-approved licenses.
